It honestly left me standing there, with just a thought (a very silly thought at that). Me playing Minecraft following <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/ArticKraft\">ArticKraft</a>’s videos on base building. Silly, I warned ya, nevertheless it left me thinking because I haven’t even glanced at that YouTuber since I was 12 or 13, and the fact that when the song played I immediately remembered the name of the YouTuber is wild. The same happens with, for example, the opening music from an Apple Event, I can recall precisely what event it was played and what they introduced at it. </p>\n<p>This is an example of how music is really tangled into memories, I like to think of it as if it were the EXIF data (aka. Metadata) of a picture, except that with no aperture, camera and manufacturer’s data, but with the smells, music and good memories that can be retained from that moment. Again, this is wild. There is a chapter in the book called <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-55004-5\"><em>Springer Handbook of Systematic Musicology</em></a> called <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323928106_Long-Term_Memory_for_Music\"><em>Long-Term Memory for Music</em></a> and it explains exceptionally well what I’m trying to convey over here… I might just be a Senior HS Student, therefore, just a mere opinion that has no weigh on anything, but I just like thinking about this stuff. Anyways, thanks for reading my silly thoughts, catch ya in the next one!</p>\n",

Honestly, I know that it has way less functionality than the Apple Pencil, but the shape... ANYWAYS! We're getting off track. Where were we... Oh yeah!

To be clear, my goal buying the iPad was to have a device that I could take to school, get rid of my physical notebooks and books, and just... Carry it! Practically no weight at all.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    As of writing this post, I've been using the iPad for a month and a bit. I've been using GoodNotes for my notetaking, as well as Quick Notes for when I have to jot something on the go (Perfect for when the teacher starts saying what's gonna be in the exam and you have nothing open). You might be wondering what has been of my previous notes on the physical notebooks, so the answer is... I scanned them all! it might not conserve the OCR but to be honest, I didn't have that either before.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blog.intron014.com/media/posts/5/Imagen-PNG_ipad_spacegrey_landscape.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.intron014.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Imagen-PNG_ipad_spacegrey_landscape-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.intron014.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Imagen-PNG_ipad_spacegrey_landscape-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.intron014.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Imagen-PNG_ipad_spacegrey_landscape-md.png 768w ,https://blog.intron014.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Imagen-PNG_ipad_spacegrey_landscape-lg.png 1024w ,https://blog.intron014.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Imagen-PNG_ipad_spacegrey_landscape-xl.png 1360w ,https://blog.intron014.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Imagen-PNG_ipad_spacegrey_landscape-2xl.png 1600w\"  height=\"1920\" width=\"2710\" alt=\"My iPad's School Screen\" />\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    On another note, shortcuts has been of great help! As you can see by the screenshot above, I have a very handy dandy Shortcut to add a new exam to my calendar following my usual naming scheme, perfection! (Also starring... Widgetsmith and Apollo!)\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    So yeah, in conclusion... This iPad is really (from what I've been able to tell for now) a great device!\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>",

Just getting away from the busy life that is ours.&nbsp;<br><br>This poem was written (or at least published) in 1993, so it's as we say now.. Pre-COVID.

The shopping. A walk in the park.<br>This is peace and contentment. It’s new.<br><br>The rest of the day was quite easy.<br>I did all the jobs on my list<br>And enjoyed them and had some time over.<br>I love you.
